The President gave a full-throated praise to Elon Musk for his efforts to cut the federal government waste through his leadership of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. However, DOGE actions have also raised concerns as well as received backlash from certain quarters. For, DOGE has moved rapidly from one federal department to another to dismantle agencies, cut programmes and fire federal employees.Responding to the backlash and hate, Elon Musk reiterated his stand that what he and his is doing is for the good of America. A post from 'Tesla Owners Silicon Valley' account on Twitter quoted Elon Musk as saying: 'I will fight for and die in America'. Responding to the same Elon Musk wrote a one-word emphatic answer: Yes and shared the emoji of American flag.

In a post on Twitter, Elon Musk wrote an affirmative 'Yes' to a post from 'Tesla Owners Silicon Valley' that says: 'Don‚Äôt Google it. Grok it.' Grok is positioned it as competitor to OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT as well as Google Gemini and other AI Chatbots.

Other than Fort Know, vast quantities of Gold are also reported to be held at mints in West Point, Denver and at the Federal Reserve vault in New York.Coming to the latest on Grok, Elon Musk's xAI recently unveiled an enhanced version of its Grok-3 chatbot. This launch comes shortly after OpenAI rejected Elon Musk's $97.4 billion offer to acquire its nonprofit division. During a livestream, xAI claimed that Grok-3 surpasses OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o, Google‚Äôs Gemini, DeepSeek‚Äôs V3, and Anthropic‚Äôs Claude across various math, science, and coding benchmarks. Musk highlighted that Grok-3 boasts over ten times the computational power of its predecessor, with pre-training finalized in early January.These performance claims, yet to be independently verified, heat up the rivalry between xAI and OpenAI.

Ashley's version of the storyAshley made the claim on social media and said she had to do this because tabloid media already got to know that Elon Musk is the father of her child. Then she sued Elon Musk seeking sole custody of the child. In her lawsuit, she attached screenshots of her chats with someone whose name she saved on her phone as 'EM'. EM asked her about her wellbeing after the childbirth and also said he wanted to 'knock her up again'. In May 2023, Ashley and his then-boss Seth Dillon, the CEO of Babylon Bee, a satire website, went to meet Elon Musk at the Twitter (now X) headquarters in San Francisco for an interview. Ashley revealed the photos of meeting Elon. Soon after, according to Ashley's story, Elon Musk 'slid' into her DMs and their apparent romance began. This romance continued till she got pregnant. Elon Musk asked her to keep it a secret and kept her in a luxurious apartment with a large security detail. She said Elon Musk met with the child only once and did not even ask for his photos.

The controversy arose after Musk was seen making a gesture during President Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration celebration in January, which some critics interpreted as a fascist salute. The incident has sparked widespread debate, with Jewish organizations, politicians, and advocacy groups calling for clarification.In a recent three-hour appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Musk addressed the backlash, stating that the gesture was not intended as a Nazi salute and expressing frustration over the growing criticisms. He also spoke about the toll of online hate, claiming that there are active discussions on social media platforms about harming him. While some groups condemned his actions, others, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), defended Musk, arguing that the gesture was taken out of context.The controversy has been further fueled by Musk‚Äôs previous comments and his political affiliations, particularly his perceived support for Germany‚Äôs far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The debate continues to draw widespread attention, with many questioning Musk‚Äôs stance on extremism.Elon Musk dismisses Nazi allegations, says critics ‚Äòwant to kill me‚ÄôDuring Trump's inauguration celebration in January, Musk was seen making a diagonal arm movement while addressing the crowd. The gesture immediately caught the attention of political figures and advocacy groups, with some interpreting it as a version of the Nazi salute.Michel Friedman, former vice president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called Musk‚Äôs actions a ""disgrace"" and claimed it was a clear ""Heil Hitler"" salute. U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler also condemned the gesture, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Musk to clarify his intent.Amid the criticism, Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) was flooded with accusations, with some users labeling the billionaire a Nazi sympathizer. The ADL, however, took a more neutral stance, suggesting that Musk‚Äôs gesture was likely ""an awkward moment of enthusiasm rather than a deliberate Nazi salute.""Elon Musk responds with humour and denialFollowing the backlash, Musk took to X to refute the allegations, responding with a series of puns referencing Nazi leaders, including phrases like ""Don't say Hess to Nazi accusations!"" and ""Bet you did nazi that coming."" While some found the remarks humorous, others criticized him for making light of the situation.During his interview with Joe Rogan, Musk reiterated his denial, stating:""Hopefully people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi.""He went on to argue that the term ""Nazi"" should only be applied to individuals engaging in actions like genocide or war.""What‚Äôs relevant about Nazis is, like, are you invading Poland? And if you‚Äôre not invading Poland, maybe you‚Äôre not a Nazi,"" Musk remarked.He added, ""You have to be committing genocide and starting wars. What is actually bad about Nazis‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.""Musk also expressed frustration over the relentless criticism he receives, stating, ""Now I can never point at things diagonally.""Musk discusses online hate and death threatsDuring the interview, Musk revealed that the backlash has taken a personal toll, describing it as ""pretty stressful."" He claimed that some online communities actively discuss harming him, saying:""They actually want to kill me. They say so online. There are Reddit forums where they don‚Äôt just want to kill me, they want to desecrate my corpse.""The billionaire has faced multiple controversies in recent years, ranging from his political endorsements to allegations of promoting misinformation on X. Musk‚Äôs leadership of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a newly formed agency under Trump, has further intensified scrutiny, with critics accusing him of using his government position for personal and political influence.Political controversy and far-right allegationsMusk‚Äôs remarks about Nazis are not the only reason his critics have accused him of having far-right sympathies. The CEO has faced backlash for showing support for Germany‚Äôs Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, a nationalist and anti-immigration group.AfD leaders have been accused of downplaying Nazi crimes, with one member referring to the Holocaust as a mere ""speck of bird poop"" in Germany‚Äôs history. The party has also been known to repurpose Nazi slogans and advocate for policies that critics say are reminiscent of Germany‚Äôs dark past.Although Musk has not officially endorsed AfD, his interactions with far-right figures and his vocal criticisms of progressive policies have led many to question his political leanings.Ongoing debate and public reactionThe controversy surrounding Musk‚Äôs alleged Nazi salute and his political views has sparked fierce debate across social media and news platforms. While some argue that Musk is being unfairly targeted, others believe his actions and statements warrant scrutiny.Musk has not issued an official statement beyond his remarks on X and Rogan‚Äôs podcast. However, as the conversation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the backlash will impact his businesses or political standing.For now, the billionaire appears to be standing his ground, dismissing the accusations while expressing frustration over what he perceives as unwarranted hostility. Whether this controversy will fade or escalate further will likely depend on Musk‚Äôs future actions and public responses.Also read | Airtel recharge plans | Jio recharge plans | BSNL recharge plans","What is actually bad about Nazis‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.

Elon Musk has often warned about declining populations in several Asian countries, including Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Elon Musk even went on to say that Singapore is particularly at risk due to its falling birth rate and is almost on the verge of extinction. In a warning post some time back, Elon Musk wrote, ‚ÄúSingapore will go extinct in some time.‚Äù Elon Musk has expressed similar concern about South Korea and Japan.Zoho CEO Vembu in a post on Twitter said that the '996' culture strogly getting popular in China simply mean ever sinking birth rates.

Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates,"" wrote Vembu.In another post, Vembu made a similar observation about San Fancisco. He wrote, how he did not see children playing in parks in and around SF bay area. ""I visited the SF bay area this week, staying near the Apple HQ, an area of beautiful multi-million dollar homes, well maintained parks - but hardly any young children roaming the wide open residential streets (hardly any traffic) or playing in the parks.

What appeared to the outside world as ""Japanese brands everywhere"" really was about ""too many companies, funded with cheap loans, desperately fighting it out in the global market"". In one sense Japan never really recovered, their companies lost their drive as their workforce aged (decades of ultra low birth rates do that to you) and then Korea/China took over from them. Japan achieved ""Karoshi"" - death due to overwork - on a civilizational scale.As an aside, we have seen that in silicon valley too - for example in Saas business and now in AI. Unlike in Japan and China, where bank and government backed loans dominated the investment, in silicon valley it was VC and PE. Over-investment leads to too many companies chasing too few customers. Marketing spending goes through the roof and there is no real profit (you do get ""profit when we don't count the expenses we push to shareholders"" stuff).Globalization of the past 40 years has been driven by infinitely stretchable balance sheets at every level but the imbalances have reached such an extreme that they can no longer be ignored. These trade wars didn't happen out of the blue.What is the alternative?We have to embrace economic balance - production and consumption balanced regionally, which means production balanced by real income to consume the production regionally.We have to question the entire premise of this era of massive imbalances-led globalization.
