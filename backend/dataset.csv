In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Altman announced that GPT-4.5 is expected to roll out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. However, he noted that the update will be a staggered rollout over several days to manage high demand and ensure a smooth user experience. Altman also explained that launching with a low rate limit would restrict usage and prevent users from having meaningful interactions with the new model. The staggered release will allow users to have longer conversations with GPT-4.5, even if it means some subscribers will have to wait a bit longer to access it. In his X announcement, Altman wrote: “We are likely going to roll out GPT-4.5 to the plus tier over a few days. There is no perfect way to do this; we wanted to do it for everyone tomorrow, but it would have meant we had to launch with a very low rate limit. We think people are gonna use this a lot and love it.”Replying to his post, Altman added: “So we think it's better to let people have real, long conversations with it, but that means we have to stagger people in rather than have everyone hit it hard at the same time. Hope that makes sense and look forward to seeing your feedback!”Altman praises team working on AI modelsLater, Altman also shared a separate post on X to praise the OpenAI team’s achievements, particularly the company’s advancements. In this post, he wrote: “Very proud of the OpenAI team for what is perhaps the most impressive scientific/technical breakthrough of recent decades. Thought that was the thing I'd always be most proud of in life. Turns out I am now more proud of a preemie baby for learning how to eat on his own.”Commenting on this post, Altman also noted: “I realize I am getting neurochemically hacked here but idc, it's the best.”Last week, OpenAI announced the GPT-4.5 model, the final version that doesn’t use chain-of-thought prompting—a technique that simulates human reasoning by breaking tasks into steps.","Hope that makes sense and look forward to seeing your feedback!”Altman praises team working on AI modelsLater, Altman also shared a separate post on X to praise the OpenAI team’s achievements, particularly the company’s advancements.

latest, Qualcomm Ceo Cristiano Amon Repeats His 'Iphone Prediction' For The Year 2027 ,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/qualcomm-ceo-cristiano-amon-repeats-his-iphone-prediction-for-the-year-2027/articleshow/118761037.cms," Mar 06, 2025, 17:04 (IST)","Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon is betting big on the company's latest high-end modem, X85. In an interview with CNBC, Amon claimed that the company's latest X85 modem will significantly outperform Apple's recently introduced C1 modem, creating a substantial performance gap between premium Android devices and iPhones. Announced recently, Qualcomm's high-end X85 modem integrates advanced AI capabilities, enhancing its ability to handle weaker signals and extend performance range, according to Amon. Qualcomm CEO added, ""It’s the first modem with so much AI."" Apple recently entered the smartphone modem race with Apple C1, its first self-designed modem. Apple C1 modem made its debut in Apple's latest addition in iPhone 16 series, iPhone 16e. For years, Apple has sourced modems from Qualcomm, the world's biggest supplier of the chips. Qualcomm chips also power Android gadgets and Windows laptops.Qualcomm CEO on iPhonesWhile talking about how X85 modem will give Android phones an edge over iPhones, Qualcomm CEO also reiterated his earlier 'iPhone prediction' that he expects Qualcomm will not supply Apple with modems in 2027. At the same time, Amon expressed confidence in Qualcomm's edge. “If modem is relevant there’s always a place for Qualcomm technology,” Amon said. He added, “In the age of AI, modems are going to be more important than they have ever been. And I think that’s going to drive consumer preference about do they want the best possible modem in the computer that’s in their hand all the time.” How Apple's entry in modem race goes back to 2019Modems, essential for connecting smartphones to mobile networks, have been a core strength of Qualcomm. The company has been a leading global supplier of modems for Apple's iPhones. However, in July 2019, Apple and Intel signed an agreement for Apple to acquire the majority of Intel’s smartphone modem business. Approximately 2,200 Intel employees join Apple, along with intellectual property, equipment and leases. Apple's acquisition of Intel's modem division made it clear that the company wants to go its own way and follow the same strategy as it has for smartphone processors. The iPhone 16e, which runs on the same A18 processor chip as the rest of other phones in the iPhone 16 lineup, has the best battery life of any of its 6.1-inch phones thanks to the C1 system, Apple's Kaiann Drance, vice president of iPhone product marketing, told Reuters. The iPhone 16e also has Apple's latest artificial intelligence (AI) features.One of the ways Apple hopes that the C1 will set its iPhones apart is by tightly integrating it with its A-series processor chips. Giving an example Arun Mathias, vice president for wireless software at Apple, told the news agency that if an iPhone encounters congested data networks, the phone's processor can signal to the modem which traffic is the most time sensitive and put it ahead of other data transfers, making the phone feel more responsive to the user's needs.","“If modem is relevant there’s always a place for Qualcomm technology,” Amon said.

In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Altman announced that GPT-4.5 is expected to roll out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. However, he noted that the update will be a staggered rollout over several days to manage high demand and ensure a smooth user experience. Altman also explained that launching with a low rate limit would restrict usage and prevent users from having meaningful interactions with the new model. The staggered release will allow users to have longer conversations with GPT-4.5, even if it means some subscribers will have to wait a bit longer to access it. In his X announcement, Altman wrote: “We are likely going to roll out GPT-4.5 to the plus tier over a few days. There is no perfect way to do this; we wanted to do it for everyone tomorrow, but it would have meant we had to launch with a very low rate limit. We think people are gonna use this a lot and love it.”Replying to his post, Altman added: “So we think it's better to let people have real, long conversations with it, but that means we have to stagger people in rather than have everyone hit it hard at the same time. Hope that makes sense and look forward to seeing your feedback!”Altman praises team working on AI modelsLater, Altman also shared a separate post on X to praise the OpenAI team’s achievements, particularly the company’s advancements. In this post, he wrote: “Very proud of the OpenAI team for what is perhaps the most impressive scientific/technical breakthrough of recent decades. Thought that was the thing I'd always be most proud of in life. Turns out I am now more proud of a preemie baby for learning how to eat on his own.”Commenting on this post, Altman also noted: “I realize I am getting neurochemically hacked here but idc, it's the best.”Last week, OpenAI announced the GPT-4.5 model, the final version that doesn’t use chain-of-thought prompting—a technique that simulates human reasoning by breaking tasks into steps.","Hope that makes sense and look forward to seeing your feedback!”Altman praises team working on AI modelsLater, Altman also shared a separate post on X to praise the OpenAI team’s achievements, particularly the company’s advancements.

latest, Qualcomm Ceo Cristiano Amon Repeats His 'Iphone Prediction' For The Year 2027 ,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/qualcomm-ceo-cristiano-amon-repeats-his-iphone-prediction-for-the-year-2027/articleshow/118761037.cms," Mar 06, 2025, 17:04 (IST)","Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon is betting big on the company's latest high-end modem, X85. In an interview with CNBC, Amon claimed that the company's latest X85 modem will significantly outperform Apple's recently introduced C1 modem, creating a substantial performance gap between premium Android devices and iPhones. Announced recently, Qualcomm's high-end X85 modem integrates advanced AI capabilities, enhancing its ability to handle weaker signals and extend performance range, according to Amon. Qualcomm CEO added, ""It’s the first modem with so much AI."" Apple recently entered the smartphone modem race with Apple C1, its first self-designed modem. Apple C1 modem made its debut in Apple's latest addition in iPhone 16 series, iPhone 16e. For years, Apple has sourced modems from Qualcomm, the world's biggest supplier of the chips. Qualcomm chips also power Android gadgets and Windows laptops.Qualcomm CEO on iPhonesWhile talking about how X85 modem will give Android phones an edge over iPhones, Qualcomm CEO also reiterated his earlier 'iPhone prediction' that he expects Qualcomm will not supply Apple with modems in 2027. At the same time, Amon expressed confidence in Qualcomm's edge. “If modem is relevant there’s always a place for Qualcomm technology,” Amon said. He added, “In the age of AI, modems are going to be more important than they have ever been. And I think that’s going to drive consumer preference about do they want the best possible modem in the computer that’s in their hand all the time.” How Apple's entry in modem race goes back to 2019Modems, essential for connecting smartphones to mobile networks, have been a core strength of Qualcomm. The company has been a leading global supplier of modems for Apple's iPhones. However, in July 2019, Apple and Intel signed an agreement for Apple to acquire the majority of Intel’s smartphone modem business. Approximately 2,200 Intel employees join Apple, along with intellectual property, equipment and leases. Apple's acquisition of Intel's modem division made it clear that the company wants to go its own way and follow the same strategy as it has for smartphone processors. The iPhone 16e, which runs on the same A18 processor chip as the rest of other phones in the iPhone 16 lineup, has the best battery life of any of its 6.1-inch phones thanks to the C1 system, Apple's Kaiann Drance, vice president of iPhone product marketing, told Reuters. The iPhone 16e also has Apple's latest artificial intelligence (AI) features.One of the ways Apple hopes that the C1 will set its iPhones apart is by tightly integrating it with its A-series processor chips. Giving an example Arun Mathias, vice president for wireless software at Apple, told the news agency that if an iPhone encounters congested data networks, the phone's processor can signal to the modem which traffic is the most time sensitive and put it ahead of other data transfers, making the phone feel more responsive to the user's needs.","“If modem is relevant there’s always a place for Qualcomm technology,” Amon said.

As expected, they were stopped by a big contingent of Delhi Police. The house had been barricaded.""For months, BJP leaders have been shouting that the Delhi chief minister's residence has a gold toilet, a swimming pool and a mini bar. I brought the media here along with our minister.

The bungalow had been offered last year to chief minister Atishi but was reclaimed by PWD on Jan 6, which, according to Delhi Police, had asked for police deployment outside the house, anticipating a law-and-order problem. The PWD is currently in possession of the bungalow and has offered two other bungalows to Atishi.After being stopped by the cops, both AAP functionaries sat on a dharna outside the residence for a few minutes. Later, they left for Prime Minister Narendar Modi's residence at 7 Lok Kalyan Marg.On the way, they were intercepted by Delhi Police at the Teen Murti roundabout, which is close to the PM's residence.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received. Fast forward to today, and their friendship is still going strong, with Modi recently meeting Trump during his U.S. visit. These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump.

Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony.

But he thinks this may not be enough for him to be successful in India. And among the reasons include two of India's biggest Business Groups in the auto segment -- Tata Group and Mahindra Group. Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US. He’s super smart, no question about it. He’s a maverick, doing spacecraft and all that. He’s done amazing work, so I don’t want to take anything from him. But to be successful in India is not an easy job,"" Jindal said.Elon Musk’s Tesla is reportedly all set to enter Indian shores. The company has reportedly finalised the location for its first showroom in the country.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success.

The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump.

Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion.

The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful.

The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony.

But he thinks this may not be enough for him to be successful in India. And among the reasons include two of India's biggest Business Groups in the auto segment -- Tata Group and Mahindra Group. Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US. He’s super smart, no question about it. He’s a maverick, doing spacecraft and all that. He’s done amazing work, so I don’t want to take anything from him. But to be successful in India is not an easy job,"" Jindal said.Elon Musk’s Tesla is reportedly all set to enter Indian shores. The company has reportedly finalised the location for its first showroom in the country.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech. He highlighted how these communities went from being the nation's ""last villages"" to becoming its ""first villages."" There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony.

But he thinks this may not be enough for him to be successful in India. And among the reasons include two of India's biggest Business Groups in the auto segment -- Tata Group and Mahindra Group. Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US. He’s super smart, no question about it. He’s a maverick, doing spacecraft and all that. He’s done amazing work, so I don’t want to take anything from him. But to be successful in India is not an easy job,"" Jindal said.Elon Musk’s Tesla is reportedly all set to enter Indian shores. The company has reportedly finalised the location for its first showroom in the country.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech. He highlighted how these communities went from being the nation's ""last villages"" to becoming its ""first villages."" There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump.

Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility.

""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony.

But he thinks this may not be enough for him to be successful in India. And among the reasons include two of India's biggest Business Groups in the auto segment -- Tata Group and Mahindra Group. Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US. He’s super smart, no question about it. He’s a maverick, doing spacecraft and all that. He’s done amazing work, so I don’t want to take anything from him. But to be successful in India is not an easy job,"" Jindal said.Elon Musk’s Tesla is reportedly all set to enter Indian shores. The company has reportedly finalised the location for its first showroom in the country. According to a report in news agency Reuters, citing registration papers, Tesla has signed a lease deal to open its showroom in Mumbai. The showroom is reported to be opened in the Maker Maxity building in the business and retail hub of Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) near Mumbai airport.Tesla India entry and PM Narendra Modi's US visitReports about Tesla's India entry started just days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the United States.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech. He highlighted how these communities went from being the nation's ""last villages"" to becoming its ""first villages."" There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received. Fast forward to today, and their friendship is still going strong, with Modi recently meeting Trump during his U.S. visit. These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump.

Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech. He highlighted how these communities went from being the nation's ""last villages"" to becoming its ""first villages."" There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Judge Pablo Zuniga of the Federal Regional Court overturned a previous ruling and reinstated an injunction from Brazil's antitrust authority, CADE. The Administrative Council for Economic Defense or CADE is an independent agency reporting to Brazil's Ministry of Justice.Valor International reports that Zuniga justified the decision by noting that ""Apple has already complied with similar obligations in other countries without demonstrating significant impact or irreparable harm to its economic model.""What is case against Apple in Brazil all aboutThe case originated from a 2022 complaint by Latin American e-commerce company Mercado Livre, which accused Apple of abusing its dominant market position by forcing developers to use Apple's payment system for digital goods and services.Apple plans to appeal the decision, stating: ""We are concerned that the interim measures proposed by CADE would undermine the privacy and security of our users."" The company has used similar security and privacy arguments when fighting against app sideloading in other regions.Brazil's antitrust investigation follows similar regulatory action in the European Union, where Apple was forced to allow alternative app stores under the Digital Markets Act. Apple implemented these changes for EU users with iOS 17.4, creating a precedent that Judge Zuniga referenced in his ruling.The 90-day Deadline for AppleThe judge extended the implementation timeline from CADE's original 20-day requirement to 90 days, acknowledging that ""structural changes in operating systems require some planning and technical development.""If the ruling stands, Brazil would become the second major market after the EU where Apple must open its tightly controlled iOS ecosystem to alternative app distribution methods, potentially setting a precedent for similar actions in other countries.","Judge Pablo Zuniga of the Federal Regional Court overturned a previous ruling and reinstated an injunction from Brazil's antitrust authority, CADE.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskky clarified multiple times that he would not wear a suit until the Russia-Ukraine war comes to an end. His sartorial choice became a major issue during his White House visit before it turned into a full-blown war of words resulting in an unexpected showdown -- as he was asked why he was not wearing a suit. Illia Ponomarenko, a Ukrainian journalist has now told POLITICO that though Zelenskyy's black outfit was seen as casual wear by most Americans, it was not. It was much like his olive-green combat outfit, part of a culture of people who are involved in the war. Zelenskyy's clothes send an anti-elitist messagelllia Ponomarenko said Zelenskyy's clothes send a soft and anti-elitist message. ""When he meets with prominent figures and power brokers, his clothes are basically asking, what are you about? Are you about the business of saving lives, or are you about fancy protocols? Even when he meets with kings, he dresses in a way that represents the average Ukrainian involved in this war effort. So it’s a message to say, 'I’ve come to the corners of power as a representative of my humble people',"" he said. Zelenskyy prefers clothes from M-TAC brandThe journalist said that Zeelenskyy prefers to wear clothes from Ukrainian brands like M-TAC which produces clothes that could also be considered casual. ""But some of these clothes are also the things you'd wear in war zones. These are the same clothes you might wear with body armor and a military combat jacket. When I was working as a war reporter, I had a sweater that was pretty close to what Zelenskyy wore during that meeting,"" he said adding that the black outfit was something that could have been easily worn by someone in the military. Ukrainian trident most importantThe most important part of Zelenskyy's outfit that day was the Ukrainian trident which is one of the key national symbols. Ukrainian designer Elvira Gasanova earlier said the trident set him apart as he's a wartime leader who does not need suits. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Zelenskyy has not deviated from his olive and black T-shirts, sweatshirts that he teas with cargo trousers.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskky clarified multiple times that he would not wear a suit until the Russia-Ukraine war comes to an end.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received. Fast forward to today, and their friendship is still going strong, with Modi recently meeting Trump during his U.S. visit. These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump. What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it. Modi, with his massive social media following and influence, could pitch Indian wrestlers to WWE execs. Trump, a WWE Hall of Famer (yes, really), could use his insider connections to make it happen. Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility. So, will Modi and Trump become the ultimate power brokers for Indian wrestling? Only time will tell.","What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony.

He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan.

The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion.

For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump. What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it. Modi, with his massive social media following and influence, could pitch Indian wrestlers to WWE execs. Trump, a WWE Hall of Famer (yes, really), could use his insider connections to make it happen. Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility. So, will Modi and Trump become the ultimate power brokers for Indian wrestling? Only time will tell.","What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US. He’s super smart, no question about it. He’s a maverick, doing spacecraft and all that. He’s done amazing work, so I don’t want to take anything from him. But to be successful in India is not an easy job,"" Jindal said.Elon Musk’s Tesla is reportedly all set to enter Indian shores. The company has reportedly finalised the location for its first showroom in the country.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful.

The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump.

Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan.

The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion.

The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful.

The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony.

But he thinks this may not be enough for him to be successful in India. And among the reasons include two of India's biggest Business Groups in the auto segment -- Tata Group and Mahindra Group. Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US. He’s super smart, no question about it. He’s a maverick, doing spacecraft and all that. He’s done amazing work, so I don’t want to take anything from him. But to be successful in India is not an easy job,"" Jindal said.Elon Musk’s Tesla is reportedly all set to enter Indian shores. The company has reportedly finalised the location for its first showroom in the country.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech. He highlighted how these communities went from being the nation's ""last villages"" to becoming its ""first villages."" There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony.

But he thinks this may not be enough for him to be successful in India. And among the reasons include two of India's biggest Business Groups in the auto segment -- Tata Group and Mahindra Group. Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US. He’s super smart, no question about it. He’s a maverick, doing spacecraft and all that. He’s done amazing work, so I don’t want to take anything from him. But to be successful in India is not an easy job,"" Jindal said.Elon Musk’s Tesla is reportedly all set to enter Indian shores. The company has reportedly finalised the location for its first showroom in the country.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech. He highlighted how these communities went from being the nation's ""last villages"" to becoming its ""first villages."" There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Ashley's version of the storyAshley made the claim on social media and said she had to do this because tabloid media already got to know that Elon Musk is the father of her child. Then she sued Elon Musk seeking sole custody of the child. In her lawsuit, she attached screenshots of her chats with someone whose name she saved on her phone as 'EM'. EM asked her about her wellbeing after the childbirth and also said he wanted to 'knock her up again'. In May 2023, Ashley and his then-boss Seth Dillon, the CEO of Babylon Bee, a satire website, went to meet Elon Musk at the Twitter (now X) headquarters in San Francisco for an interview.

Trump has also proposed annexing the country as the 51st state, is “against the national interest of Canada,” the petitioners claim.“He has used his wealth and power to influence our elections,” the petition claims. “He has now become a member of a foreign government that is attempting to erase Canadian sovereignty.” Responding to the news about the petition, shared by a Twitter user, Elon Musk wrote: “Canada is not a real country.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk, however, later deleted the post. It is not certain why he deleted the post, considering he has been quite vocal about his opinion on a range of issues even if it is opposed by many.

The controversy arose after Musk was seen making a gesture during President Donald Trump’s inauguration celebration in January, which some critics interpreted as a fascist salute. The incident has sparked widespread debate, with Jewish organizations, politicians, and advocacy groups calling for clarification.In a recent three-hour appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Musk addressed the backlash, stating that the gesture was not intended as a Nazi salute and expressing frustration over the growing criticisms. He also spoke about the toll of online hate, claiming that there are active discussions on social media platforms about harming him. While some groups condemned his actions, others, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), defended Musk, arguing that the gesture was taken out of context.The controversy has been further fueled by Musk’s previous comments and his political affiliations, particularly his perceived support for Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The debate continues to draw widespread attention, with many questioning Musk’s stance on extremism.Elon Musk dismisses Nazi allegations, says critics ‘want to kill me’During Trump's inauguration celebration in January, Musk was seen making a diagonal arm movement while addressing the crowd. The gesture immediately caught the attention of political figures and advocacy groups, with some interpreting it as a version of the Nazi salute.Michel Friedman, former vice president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called Musk’s actions a ""disgrace"" and claimed it was a clear ""Heil Hitler"" salute. U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler also condemned the gesture, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Musk to clarify his intent.Amid the criticism, Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) was flooded with accusations, with some users labeling the billionaire a Nazi sympathizer. The ADL, however, took a more neutral stance, suggesting that Musk’s gesture was likely ""an awkward moment of enthusiasm rather than a deliberate Nazi salute.""Elon Musk responds with humour and denialFollowing the backlash, Musk took to X to refute the allegations, responding with a series of puns referencing Nazi leaders, including phrases like ""Don't say Hess to Nazi accusations!"" and ""Bet you did nazi that coming."" While some found the remarks humorous, others criticized him for making light of the situation.During his interview with Joe Rogan, Musk reiterated his denial, stating:""Hopefully people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi.""He went on to argue that the term ""Nazi"" should only be applied to individuals engaging in actions like genocide or war.""What’s relevant about Nazis is, like, are you invading Poland? And if you’re not invading Poland, maybe you’re not a Nazi,"" Musk remarked.He added, ""You have to be committing genocide and starting wars. What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.""Musk also expressed frustration over the relentless criticism he receives, stating, ""Now I can never point at things diagonally.""Musk discusses online hate and death threatsDuring the interview, Musk revealed that the backlash has taken a personal toll, describing it as ""pretty stressful."" He claimed that some online communities actively discuss harming him, saying:""They actually want to kill me. They say so online. There are Reddit forums where they don’t just want to kill me, they want to desecrate my corpse.""The billionaire has faced multiple controversies in recent years, ranging from his political endorsements to allegations of promoting misinformation on X. Musk’s leadership of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a newly formed agency under Trump, has further intensified scrutiny, with critics accusing him of using his government position for personal and political influence.Political controversy and far-right allegationsMusk’s remarks about Nazis are not the only reason his critics have accused him of having far-right sympathies. The CEO has faced backlash for showing support for Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, a nationalist and anti-immigration group.AfD leaders have been accused of downplaying Nazi crimes, with one member referring to the Holocaust as a mere ""speck of bird poop"" in Germany’s history. The party has also been known to repurpose Nazi slogans and advocate for policies that critics say are reminiscent of Germany’s dark past.Although Musk has not officially endorsed AfD, his interactions with far-right figures and his vocal criticisms of progressive policies have led many to question his political leanings.Ongoing debate and public reactionThe controversy surrounding Musk’s alleged Nazi salute and his political views has sparked fierce debate across social media and news platforms. While some argue that Musk is being unfairly targeted, others believe his actions and statements warrant scrutiny.Musk has not issued an official statement beyond his remarks on X and Rogan’s podcast. However, as the conversation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the backlash will impact his businesses or political standing.For now, the billionaire appears to be standing his ground, dismissing the accusations while expressing frustration over what he perceives as unwarranted hostility. Whether this controversy will fade or escalate further will likely depend on Musk’s future actions and public responses.Also read | Airtel recharge plans | Jio recharge plans | BSNL recharge plans","What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.

Elon Musk has often warned about declining populations in several Asian countries, including Japan, Singapore and South Korea.

In a warning post some time back, Elon Musk wrote, “Singapore will go extinct in some time.” Elon Musk has expressed similar concern about South Korea and Japan.Zoho CEO Vembu in a post on Twitter said that the '996' culture strogly getting popular in China simply mean ever sinking birth rates. ""As Prof Pettis explains, the Chinese private sector suffers from ""neijuan"" - extreme predatory competition driven by and driving over-investment. Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates,"" wrote Vembu.In another post, Vembu made a similar observation about San Fancisco. He wrote, how he did not see children playing in parks in and around SF bay area. ""I visited the SF bay area this week, staying near the Apple HQ, an area of beautiful multi-million dollar homes, well maintained parks - but hardly any young children roaming the wide open residential streets (hardly any traffic) or playing in the parks.

What appeared to the outside world as ""Japanese brands everywhere"" really was about ""too many companies, funded with cheap loans, desperately fighting it out in the global market"". In one sense Japan never really recovered, their companies lost their drive as their workforce aged (decades of ultra low birth rates do that to you) and then Korea/China took over from them. Japan achieved ""Karoshi"" - death due to overwork - on a civilizational scale.As an aside, we have seen that in silicon valley too - for example in Saas business and now in AI. Unlike in Japan and China, where bank and government backed loans dominated the investment, in silicon valley it was VC and PE. Over-investment leads to too many companies chasing too few customers. Marketing spending goes through the roof and there is no real profit (you do get ""profit when we don't count the expenses we push to shareholders"" stuff).Globalization of the past 40 years has been driven by infinitely stretchable balance sheets at every level but the imbalances have reached such an extreme that they can no longer be ignored. These trade wars didn't happen out of the blue.What is the alternative?We have to embrace economic balance - production and consumption balanced regionally, which means production balanced by real income to consume the production regionally.We have to question the entire premise of this era of massive imbalances-led globalization.

The controversy arose after Musk was seen making a gesture during President Donald Trump’s inauguration celebration in January, which some critics interpreted as a fascist salute. The incident has sparked widespread debate, with Jewish organizations, politicians, and advocacy groups calling for clarification.In a recent three-hour appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Musk addressed the backlash, stating that the gesture was not intended as a Nazi salute and expressing frustration over the growing criticisms. He also spoke about the toll of online hate, claiming that there are active discussions on social media platforms about harming him. While some groups condemned his actions, others, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), defended Musk, arguing that the gesture was taken out of context.The controversy has been further fueled by Musk’s previous comments and his political affiliations, particularly his perceived support for Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The debate continues to draw widespread attention, with many questioning Musk’s stance on extremism.Elon Musk dismisses Nazi allegations, says critics ‘want to kill me’During Trump's inauguration celebration in January, Musk was seen making a diagonal arm movement while addressing the crowd. The gesture immediately caught the attention of political figures and advocacy groups, with some interpreting it as a version of the Nazi salute.Michel Friedman, former vice president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called Musk’s actions a ""disgrace"" and claimed it was a clear ""Heil Hitler"" salute. U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler also condemned the gesture, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Musk to clarify his intent.Amid the criticism, Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) was flooded with accusations, with some users labeling the billionaire a Nazi sympathizer. The ADL, however, took a more neutral stance, suggesting that Musk’s gesture was likely ""an awkward moment of enthusiasm rather than a deliberate Nazi salute.""Elon Musk responds with humour and denialFollowing the backlash, Musk took to X to refute the allegations, responding with a series of puns referencing Nazi leaders, including phrases like ""Don't say Hess to Nazi accusations!"" and ""Bet you did nazi that coming."" While some found the remarks humorous, others criticized him for making light of the situation.During his interview with Joe Rogan, Musk reiterated his denial, stating:""Hopefully people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi.""He went on to argue that the term ""Nazi"" should only be applied to individuals engaging in actions like genocide or war.""What’s relevant about Nazis is, like, are you invading Poland? And if you’re not invading Poland, maybe you’re not a Nazi,"" Musk remarked.He added, ""You have to be committing genocide and starting wars. What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.""Musk also expressed frustration over the relentless criticism he receives, stating, ""Now I can never point at things diagonally.""Musk discusses online hate and death threatsDuring the interview, Musk revealed that the backlash has taken a personal toll, describing it as ""pretty stressful."" He claimed that some online communities actively discuss harming him, saying:""They actually want to kill me. They say so online. There are Reddit forums where they don’t just want to kill me, they want to desecrate my corpse.""The billionaire has faced multiple controversies in recent years, ranging from his political endorsements to allegations of promoting misinformation on X. Musk’s leadership of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a newly formed agency under Trump, has further intensified scrutiny, with critics accusing him of using his government position for personal and political influence.Political controversy and far-right allegationsMusk’s remarks about Nazis are not the only reason his critics have accused him of having far-right sympathies. The CEO has faced backlash for showing support for Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, a nationalist and anti-immigration group.AfD leaders have been accused of downplaying Nazi crimes, with one member referring to the Holocaust as a mere ""speck of bird poop"" in Germany’s history. The party has also been known to repurpose Nazi slogans and advocate for policies that critics say are reminiscent of Germany’s dark past.Although Musk has not officially endorsed AfD, his interactions with far-right figures and his vocal criticisms of progressive policies have led many to question his political leanings.Ongoing debate and public reactionThe controversy surrounding Musk’s alleged Nazi salute and his political views has sparked fierce debate across social media and news platforms. While some argue that Musk is being unfairly targeted, others believe his actions and statements warrant scrutiny.Musk has not issued an official statement beyond his remarks on X and Rogan’s podcast. However, as the conversation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the backlash will impact his businesses or political standing.For now, the billionaire appears to be standing his ground, dismissing the accusations while expressing frustration over what he perceives as unwarranted hostility.

Elon Musk has often warned about declining populations in several Asian countries, including Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Elon Musk even went on to say that Singapore is particularly at risk due to its falling birth rate and is almost on the verge of extinction. In a warning post some time back, Elon Musk wrote, “Singapore will go extinct in some time.” Elon Musk has expressed similar concern about South Korea and Japan.Zoho CEO Vembu in a post on Twitter said that the '996' culture strogly getting popular in China simply mean ever sinking birth rates. ""As Prof Pettis explains, the Chinese private sector suffers from ""neijuan"" - extreme predatory competition driven by and driving over-investment. Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates,"" wrote Vembu.In another post, Vembu made a similar observation about San Fancisco. He wrote, how he did not see children playing in parks in and around SF bay area. ""I visited the SF bay area this week, staying near the Apple HQ, an area of beautiful multi-million dollar homes, well maintained parks - but hardly any young children roaming the wide open residential streets (hardly any traffic) or playing in the parks.

What appeared to the outside world as ""Japanese brands everywhere"" really was about ""too many companies, funded with cheap loans, desperately fighting it out in the global market"". In one sense Japan never really recovered, their companies lost their drive as their workforce aged (decades of ultra low birth rates do that to you) and then Korea/China took over from them. Japan achieved ""Karoshi"" - death due to overwork - on a civilizational scale.As an aside, we have seen that in silicon valley too - for example in Saas business and now in AI. Unlike in Japan and China, where bank and government backed loans dominated the investment, in silicon valley it was VC and PE. Over-investment leads to too many companies chasing too few customers. Marketing spending goes through the roof and there is no real profit (you do get ""profit when we don't count the expenses we push to shareholders"" stuff).Globalization of the past 40 years has been driven by infinitely stretchable balance sheets at every level but the imbalances have reached such an extreme that they can no longer be ignored. These trade wars didn't happen out of the blue.What is the alternative?We have to embrace economic balance - production and consumption balanced regionally, which means production balanced by real income to consume the production regionally.We have to question the entire premise of this era of massive imbalances-led globalization.

Alongside co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita, she played a crucial role in shaping Trump’s 2024 presidential bid. While keeping Trump strictly on-script was often a challenge, Wiles successfully minimised leaks, designed an effective outreach strategy to Latino and Black voters, and helped secure a decisive victory.Earlier in January, the New York Times reported that Musk was set to receive a West Wing office in close proximity to Donald Trump and had already been issued a White House email. However, a subsequent report dismissed the claim, crediting the White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles for blocking the move. The Times further reported that Wiles, known as the ""Ice Maiden"" for her cold and strategic demeanor, had blocked Musk from gaining access to the West Wing.Even when Trump himself was asked whether Musk would be given office space in the West Wing. ""No,"" Trump had said.Political analyst Dominic Michael Tripi posted on X that Susie Wiles had reportedly restricted Elon Musk’s direct access to the president, stating, “President Donald Trump’s Chief of Staff Susie Wiles has reportedly limited Elon Musk’s direct access to the President.” Musk responded by dismissing the claim with two laughing emojis.Wiles began her political career on Ronald Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaign and has since worked with moderate Republicans. Over the years, she has worked alongside several moderate Republican figures, including Jack Kemp, a staunch free-trade advocate, and Tillie Fowler, a congresswoman known for moderate positions on issues like gun control.","Alongside co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita, she played a crucial role in shaping Trump’s 2024 presidential bid.

Addressing the open BRICS plenary session, Modi made 5 suggestions to further intensify intra-BRICS cooperation including the creation of a BRICS space exploration consortium.He was speaking hours before India’s moon mission, Chandrayaan-3, successfully landed on the moon.  While seeking timelines for UNSC reforms, Modi also called for reform of multilateral financial institutions, WTO and urged BRICS to send a global message of unity and not polarisation  On BRICS expansion, the issue that dominated the summit agenda, government sources said India took the lead in forging consensus on membership criteria and selection of new members. India’s efforts are apparently guided by its objective to incorporate strategic partners like Egypt and Saudi Arabia as new members.  “India fully supports the expansion of the BRICS membership. And welcomes moving forward with consensus in this,” said the PM, adding that BRICS will be breaking barriers, revitalising economies, inspiring innovation, creating opportunities, and shaping the future.  South Africa said after the second day of the summit that the leaders agreed to a document which “set out guidelines and principles, processes for considering countries that wish to become members of BRICS”. With many developing countries looking at BRICS with renewed hope at a time of great global uncertainty, 23 countries have formally approached the grouping for membership. In his address, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for speeding up the expansion process saying more members will make global governance more just and equitable. India, however, wanted BRICS to first finalise the criteria and guiding principles for extending membership, something that the summit focused on. A formal announcement on expansion guidelines is expected on Thursday. Modi also lauded South Africa’s focus on the Global South at the summit. “We have also proposed to give permanent membership of G-20 to the African Union. I am sure all the BRICS partners are also together in the G20. And all will support our proposal. Giving special place to all these efforts in BRICS will increase the self-confidence of the countries of the Global South,” he said.  Apart from BRICS space consortium, Modi also proposed undertaking skill mapping, promoting mobility among BRICS countries and joint efforts for protection of Big Cats under International Big Cat Alliance. He also proposed establishing a repository of traditional medicine among BRICS countries.  The PM said public service delivery is being revolutionized through in India through Digital Public Infrastructure and offered the same to BRICS countries. “Diversity is a great strength of India. The solution to any problem in India comes out at the test of this diversity. That's why these solutions can be easily implemented in any corner of the world,” said Modi.","India’s efforts are apparently guided by its objective to incorporate strategic partners like Egypt and Saudi Arabia as new members.

At least three judges had earlier refused to head the commission: a reluctance which was linked to their wariness over the perception that the inquiry was politically motivated. A senior law ministry official said legally speaking, operationalization of the model code of conduct should not hinder the setting up of the commission should they find a retired judge to head it. “The decision to set up the inquiry commission was taken by the Union Cabinet much before the notification of the general elections, hence there is no legal bar on constituting one,” said the official. However, with the poll schedule in place, chances of judges stepping forward may diminish because the appointment of the panel could be seen even more through the prism of politics. In the last two months, the government has failed to convince any retired Supreme Court judge or a retired chief justice of any high court to head the commission, said sources in the law ministry. The BJP was relishing the discomfiture of the government. Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley said the UPA government’s failure to find a judge showed that the “arrogant” government was facing “moral isolation”. “One after another retired judges of the Supreme Court were approached to head the Commission. They declined to lend themselves for this politically motivated exercise. Thereafter, retired chief justices of high courts were also approached. Apparently, they also made it clear that they were not available for such exercise. The government has been morally isolated with nobody is willing to cooperate in its colourable exercise of power”. The decision to set up the commission was taken the Union cabinet on December 26 to probe the role of Modi who, according to a web portal, had allegedly given instructions to state police to put a young woman under surveillance. The surveillance of the woman was carried out by the state police in 2009, allegedly under the dictates of the political leadership. An alleged phone conversation of the then junior Gujarat home minister Amit Shah asking police officers to put the woman under surveillance for security reasons was released by a web portal. Though, the woman’s father later claimed he had requested the Gujarat CM to put his daughter under surveillance. Jaitley also stressed the refusal of noted Jurist Fali S Nariman as well as retired SC judge Justice K T Thomas to be part of the Lokpal search committee, to say that this had validated the worry that government had usurped the powers of the committee for selecting the ombussman. “They ( Nariman and Justice Thomas) believe that the process being undertaken is not intended to select the best man for the job. It is now clear that the institution of Lokpal is being damaged even prior to its creation. When eminent and independent persons of repute are refusing to associate with the search and selection exercise while suspecting the motives of the government, its moral isolation is complete”.",The government has been morally isolated with nobody is willing to cooperate in its colourable exercise of power”.

The letter describes the community as “microscopic” and “minuscule” that needs this additional protection. It further draws the PM’s attention to the Anglo-Indians’ significant contributions to the country’s progress, especially in the field of education by way of establishing schools. “We need to be represented so that our voices are heard and our concerns be taken into account,” the letter says.The letter says that the only community the Constitution mentions is that of Anglo-Indians.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received. Fast forward to today, and their friendship is still going strong, with Modi recently meeting Trump during his U.S. visit. These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump. What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it. Modi, with his massive social media following and influence, could pitch Indian wrestlers to WWE execs. Trump, a WWE Hall of Famer (yes, really), could use his insider connections to make it happen. Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility. So, will Modi and Trump become the ultimate power brokers for Indian wrestling? Only time will tell.","What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US. He’s super smart, no question about it. He’s a maverick, doing spacecraft and all that. He’s done amazing work, so I don’t want to take anything from him. But to be successful in India is not an easy job,"" Jindal said.Elon Musk’s Tesla is reportedly all set to enter Indian shores. The company has reportedly finalised the location for its first showroom in the country.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received. Fast forward to today, and their friendship is still going strong, with Modi recently meeting Trump during his U.S. visit. These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump. What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it. Modi, with his massive social media following and influence, could pitch Indian wrestlers to WWE execs. Trump, a WWE Hall of Famer (yes, really), could use his insider connections to make it happen. Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility. So, will Modi and Trump become the ultimate power brokers for Indian wrestling? Only time will tell.","What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan.

The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion.

For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record.

He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar criticised Gandhi's choice of words, calling it inappropriate and a slight to Maharashtra’s pride.Bhatkhalkar demanded that Gandhi immediately retract his post on social media platform X or face legal consequences. ""Rahul Gandhi has once again insulted Maharashtra’s pride. Using ‘shraddhanjali’ instead of ‘adaranjali’ is not just a mistake. He either intentionally or unintentionally keeps expressing his disregard for iconic figures from Maharashtra. It is a serious matter,"" he said.The Maharashtra BJP unit also condemned the Congress leader’s post, alleging that the party was misusing Shivaji Maharaj’s name for political gain. ""Hindus will never forgive Congress for this,"" the BJP stated on X. The party further accused Gandhi of deliberately choosing the term “shraddhanjali” to provoke controversy on the Maratha king’s birth anniversary.Responding to the allegations, Congress state spokesperson Atul Londhe hit back at the BJP, pointing out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had previously used ""shraddhanjali"" in his tribute to Shivaji Maharaj. ""If the BJP believes using ‘shraddhanjali’ is an insult, will they demand an apology from Modi as well?"" Londhe asked.He also accused the BJP of failing to truly honour Shivaji Maharaj’s legacy, citing incidents where the party had allegedly disrespected the Maratha ruler. ""They talk about honouring Shivaji Maharaj, but what happened to the statue in Malvan (Sindhudurg district) that Modi inaugurated? It collapsed. What happened to the grand memorial in the Arabian Sea for which Modi performed ‘jalpujan’? Not a single brick has been laid,"" Londhe alleged.The Congress spokesperson further pointed out past controversies involving BJP leaders, including former Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who had made remarks about Shivaji Maharaj that sparked outrage. ""The BJP has repeatedly used Shivaji Maharaj for political gains while failing to honour his legacy. When will they apologise for their own actions?"" Londhe asked.Meanwhile, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, along with deputy chief ministers Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar, paid tribute to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at Shivneri Fort in Pune district. Fadnavis hailed the Maratha ruler as a ""management guru"" and an able administrator who established ‘Swarajya’ and ignited a sense of national pride.""Those who try to insult Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj will be shown their real place, and the state will not forgive them,"" Fadnavis told reporters after the tribute ceremony. He also reiterated the government’s commitment to preserving Shivaji Maharaj’s forts, stating that 12 of them had been nominated for UNESCO’s World Heritage Site status.Stay informed with the latest India news, updates on public holidays, and bank holidays in March.","""They talk about honouring Shivaji Maharaj, but what happened to the statue in Malvan (Sindhudurg district) that Modi inaugurated?

BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar criticised Gandhi's choice of words, calling it inappropriate and a slight to Maharashtra’s pride.Bhatkhalkar demanded that Gandhi immediately retract his post on social media platform X or face legal consequences. ""Rahul Gandhi has once again insulted Maharashtra’s pride. Using ‘shraddhanjali’ instead of ‘adaranjali’ is not just a mistake. He either intentionally or unintentionally keeps expressing his disregard for iconic figures from Maharashtra. It is a serious matter,"" he said.The Maharashtra BJP unit also condemned the Congress leader’s post, alleging that the party was misusing Shivaji Maharaj’s name for political gain. ""Hindus will never forgive Congress for this,"" the BJP stated on X. The party further accused Gandhi of deliberately choosing the term “shraddhanjali” to provoke controversy on the Maratha king’s birth anniversary.Responding to the allegations, Congress state spokesperson Atul Londhe hit back at the BJP, pointing out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had previously used ""shraddhanjali"" in his tribute to Shivaji Maharaj. ""If the BJP believes using ‘shraddhanjali’ is an insult, will they demand an apology from Modi as well?"" Londhe asked.He also accused the BJP of failing to truly honour Shivaji Maharaj’s legacy, citing incidents where the party had allegedly disrespected the Maratha ruler. ""They talk about honouring Shivaji Maharaj, but what happened to the statue in Malvan (Sindhudurg district) that Modi inaugurated? It collapsed. What happened to the grand memorial in the Arabian Sea for which Modi performed ‘jalpujan’? Not a single brick has been laid,"" Londhe alleged.The Congress spokesperson further pointed out past controversies involving BJP leaders, including former Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who had made remarks about Shivaji Maharaj that sparked outrage. ""The BJP has repeatedly used Shivaji Maharaj for political gains while failing to honour his legacy. When will they apologise for their own actions?"" Londhe asked.Meanwhile, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, along with deputy chief ministers Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar, paid tribute to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at Shivneri Fort in Pune district. Fadnavis hailed the Maratha ruler as a ""management guru"" and an able administrator who established ‘Swarajya’ and ignited a sense of national pride.""Those who try to insult Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj will be shown their real place, and the state will not forgive them,"" Fadnavis told reporters after the tribute ceremony. He also reiterated the government’s commitment to preserving Shivaji Maharaj’s forts, stating that 12 of them had been nominated for UNESCO’s World Heritage Site status.Stay informed with the latest India news, updates on public holidays, and bank holidays in March.","""They talk about honouring Shivaji Maharaj, but what happened to the statue in Malvan (Sindhudurg district) that Modi inaugurated?

His lawyer, Milind Pawar, then moved a bail application. The court sought a written response to the same from Satyaki's lawyer, Sangram Kolhatkar, who later submitted the same stating that the court ought to impose a condition restraining Gandhi from criticising Veer Savarkar during the pendency of the defamation trial.The court observed that it cannot set conditions in a case related to a bailable offence and went on to grant bail to the Congress leader against a personal release bond of Rs25,000 and a surety in the like amount.

He explained that his ""Mini-Pakistan"" remark was meant to compare Kerala's situation with Pakistan. He mentioned that if the treatment meted out to ""Hindus"" in Pakistan is similar to happenings in India, there should be action against it.""We want our country, which is a Hindu Rashtra, to remain a Hindu Rashtra,"" Rane told ANI, adding that ""Hindus"" must be protected in every way.""Kerala is very much part of India. However, the decreasing population of Hindus is something everyone should worry about. The religious conversion of Hindus into Muslims and Christians (Islam and Christianity) has become an everyday occurrence there. The love jihad cases, where Hindu women are targeted, are also increasing there. I was comparing the situation in Kerala with Pakistan. The way Hindus are treated in Pakistan, if such situations happen in our very own country, we must take action against that. That is what I was trying to say in my speech,"" Rane, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, said.Rane further stated that he was presenting facts and was accompanied by a person who has helped ""12,000 Hindu women"" by preventing them from being converted to ""Islam and Christianity.""

I was just stating the facts. I was accompanied by a gentleman who has helped 12,000 Hindu women by stopping them from getting converted to Islam and Christianity. What I said about Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, you ask anyone in the Wayanad constituency. Who are the people who support them? Which are the organisations that support them? A lot of local BJP leaders have said the same thing. Can Congress come out and say we are wrong? Can they say that there is not a single terrorist organisation that supported Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi in the elections? Let them say. We will provide more proof. Whatever I said was based on facts,"" Rane added.In a speech, Rane compared Kerala to ""Mini-Pakistan,"" saying that Congress leaders Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul Gandhi were elected as members of Parliament for precisely this reason.""Kerala is mini Pakistan; that is why Rahul Gandhi and his sister are elected from there.
